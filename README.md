# TRLM8620-Final
This is the final project for TRLM8620. Students will clone this repo to create their own shopping website by switching the content, and localize the website.

Introduction:
This project involves the development of an e-commerce website designed to sell Zara clothing. The site features Zara's latest collections for the spring and summer seasons. It is built to support bilingual functionality, offering interfaces in both English and Chinese to cater to a diverse user base. Additionally, the website is equipped to handle transactions in two different currencies, facilitating a more accessible shopping experience for international customers. The platform aims to provide a straightforward and efficient purchasing process, from product selection to checkout.
